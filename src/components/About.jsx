                    I am a goal-oriented, proactive person with an IT passion.
                    I have extensive experience at Mate Academy as a Full Stack Web Developer.
                    Mate gave me massive knowledge and practical skills in Frontend, the creation of websites, apps, and all inside logistics.
                    Technologies I am proficient in include Typescript, JavaScript(ES6), React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Node.js,
                    Express, SQL, Mongo DB, and PostgreSQL. In my previous job, I quickly mastered the profession, and thanks to my critical approach,
                    self-motivation, and discipline, I swiftly progressed to a leadership role and later became a manager.
                    My experiences gave me a lot of patience.
                    I am convinced that passion and patience make me a high-level full-stack specialist, who can with success achieve the company goals.
